# Introduction

Welcome to the Atomscan APIs documentation ðŸš€.

Atomscan is the leading blockchain explorer, search, API and analytics platform for Atomicals. The Atomicals Protocol is a simple, yet flexible protocol for minting, transferring and updating digital objects (traditionally called non-fungible tokens) for unspent transaction output (UTXO) blockchains such as Bitcoin. An Atomical (or "atom") is a way to organize the creation, transfer and updates of digital objects â€“ it is essentially a chain of digital ownership defined according to a few simple rules.n.

As a means to provide equitable access to blockchain data, we've developed the **Atomscan Developer APIs** to empower developers with direct access to Atomscan's block explorer data and services via GET/POST requests.

Atomscan's APIs are provided as a **community service** and **without warranty**, so please use what you need and no more.
